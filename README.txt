Salutations, 
I am TheDemonWolf and i got upset about some of the "features" of Stellaris, so i decided to try to fix it by creating this mod.

This mod does a few things:

-gives +100% armor to starbases in pulsar systems.
	I had enough seeing the starbases under -100% shield try to add more shield instead of armor.
	For games created after getting this modn everything is automatic, but for already ongoing games you will need to execute the command "event stellarfixed.1" (by default press Â² to open the command prompt).
