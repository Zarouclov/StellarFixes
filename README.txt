Salutations, 
I am TheDemonWolf and i got upset about some of the "features" of Stellaris, so i decided to try to fix it by creating this mod.
Feel free to ask for changes and new features, but please give an explanation for it so i can decide if it's worth changing.

This mod does a few things:

-gives scaling armor to starbases in pulsar systems.
	I had enough seeing the starbases under -100% shield try to add more shield instead of armor.
	For games created after getting this mod everything is automatic, but for already ongoing games you will need to execute the command "event stellarfixed.1" (by default press Â² to open the command prompt).

-allows for almost every empire to:
	-use the armageddon orbital bombardment, because more freedom for the player to roleplay himself why he would do that.	
		(except for pacifists)
	-do slavery, same reasons.
		(except xenophiles, egalitarians and fanatic pacifists)
	-purge, same reasons.
		(except for pacifists and fanatic xenophiles)

-fix the bug that allows the unbidden to survive a SUPERNOVAE cuz why not
